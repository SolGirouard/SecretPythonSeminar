   <h1> Lab 1 </h1>
   <h2> Overview </h2> 
   <p>In this lab we will practice the basics of functions, arithmetic, and
variables, and learn to work on the terminal. All of our work this lab will be
done within a single file called <span>lab1.py</span>.</p>

   <p>From now on, when I describe the behavior of a function I will use the
notation <span>functionName: type -&gt; type</span> to specify what the
appropriate input type and output type of the function should be. This is
called a function's <em>type signature</em>. If I say that a function has the
signature <span>f: number -&gt; number</span>, then it is called "f", it
accepts as input a single number, and produces as output a single number. </p>

   <p>While developing your code, it's important to test it to make sure it
works properly. One simple way to do this (and we will learn more complex ways
to do this) is to run your file through the python REPL. If your file is called
<span>lab1.py</span>, then you would do this as follows: </p>
   <pre>
      $ python -i lab1.py
   </pre>

   <p>This does the same thing as clicking the "Run module" button in IDLE;
it first runs your program, and then gives you access to all of the functions
and variables you defined in the REPL. You can proceed to test your function on
various inputs and outputs there. When you're done, typing Ctrl+D exits the
REPL and returns to the terminal.</p>

   <p>All of the following functions should be defined within a file called
<span>lab1.py</span></p> 

   <h2>Single-argument functions</h2>

   <h3>square: number -&gt; number</h3>
   <p>Define a function called <span>square</span> which accepts as input a
single number and returns as output the square of that number. </p>

   <h3>greet: string -&gt; string</h3>
   <p>Define a function called <span>greet</span> which accepts as input a
string (containing a name) and returns a <em>new</em> string containing "Hello,
" followed by whatever the name is.</p>

   <p>In order to accomplish this, we need to know more about strings. The
operation we're describing is called <em>concatenation,</em> and it is denoted
by the + symbol. That is, the expression <span>"a" + "b"</span> evaluates to
<span>"ab"</span>. Whenever you encounter a new feature in Python, I highly
reccommend you experiment with it in the REPL before using it in your programs.
</p>  

   <h3>triangleArea: number -&gt; number</h3>
   <p>Define a function called <span>triangleArea</span> which accepts as input
a number representing the length of the base of a triangle. We will fix the
height of this triangle to be 8. The function <span>triangleArea</span> should
return the area of this triangle. </p>

   <h2>Multiple-argument functions</h2>
   <p>In this section we will learn more about function arguments. In
particular, when you define a function you may give any number of arguments,
including zero. Here are some simple examples of functions with varying numbers
of arguments. </p>

   <pre>
      # zero arguments
      def seven():
         return 7

      # three arguments
      def sumOfThree(x, y, z):
         return x + y + z

      # four arguments:
      def hypercubeVolume(l1, l2, l3, l4):
         return l1 * l2 * l3 * l4
   </pre>

   <p>In particular, an <em>argument list</em> is a new kind of language form
that has the following syntax:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>An argument list may be empty, denoted by not typing anything</li>
      <li>If an argument list is nonempty, then it is a comma-delimited list of
variable names</li>
   </ul>

   <p>The semantics of argument lists is that they are <em>ordered</em>. That is,
the order in which you specify argument values when you call a function is the same as
how they are assigned to the list of argument variable names. Here is an
example:</p>

   <pre>
      def printThree(aString, anotherString, aThirdString):
         print aString
         print anotherString
         print aThirdString

      printThree("a", "b", "c")
      printThree("b", "c", "z")
   </pre>

   <p>In the first function call, the strings "a", "b", "c" are printed out in
that order. That is, the variable <span>aString</span> refers to the string
<span>"a"</span> in the first function call, <span>anotherString</span> to
<span>"b"</span> and <span>aThirdString</span> to <span>"c"</span>. In the
second function call, however, the variables refer to different values. Be sure
you can identify which variables correspond to which values.</p>

   <p>As a minor note, our type signatures will change to allow for multiple
variables. That is, as you can see in the next heading below, commas will
delimit the types of mulitple input arguments, so the example below is a
function which accepts as input <em>three</em> numbers and returns a number.
</p>
 
   <h3>discriminant: number, number, number -&gt; number</h3>
   <p>Define a function called <span>discriminant</span> which accepts as input
three numbers representing the coefficients of a quadratic polynomial, and
outputs the discriminant. In particular, the first argument should be the
leading coefficient (the coefficient of the squared term), the second argument
should be the coefficient of the linear term, and the third argument should be
the constant term.</p>

   <p>You should know what the discriminant of a quadratic polynomial is by
heart, but if you don't you may look it up.</p> 

<h3>prodOfQuadraticSolutions: number, number, number -&gt; number</h3>
   <p>Define a function called <span>prodOfQuadraticSolutions</span> which accepts
as input the coefficients of a quadratic polynomial (in the same order as the
previous exercise) and returns as output the product of the two solutions. You
may assume the solutions are both real, and the grading robot will only test
quadratic polynomials with two real roots. </p>

   <p>Note that this function uses the discriminant formula twice. I recommend
you use the discriminant function from the previous exercise in this exercise
(that is, call the <span>discriminant</span> function from within the body of
this function), and save its output to a variable for later use. </p>

   <p>Note that this function also uses square roots. To compute the square
root of a numerical expression in Python, you may use the following
expression:</p> 

   <pre>
      expr ** 0.5
   </pre>

   <p>That is, two asterisks denote exponentiation, and the syntax is
<span>expr ** expr</span></p>


<h3>isMultipleOfPi: number, number -&gt; boolean</h3>
   <p>Define a function called <span>isMultipleOfPi</span> which accepts as input
a number representing an angle X in radians and a decimal E representing an error
tolerance, and produces as output a boolean which is True if and only if X is
within E of an integer multiple of pi.</p>

   <p>For this we need two new tools. The first is access to python's internal
definition of pi. For this we will learn to <em>import a module</em> into our
Python program. Don't worry too much about the syntax of importing just yet,
but to do this you add the following on a line by itself at the top of your
python file:
   </p>

   <pre>
      import math 
   </pre>

   <p>Now you can access certain special functions and variables defined in the
math module from your python program. For example, to get the number pi you use
the expression <span>math.pi</span>.

   <pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; import math
&gt;&gt;&gt; math.pi
3.141592653589793
   </pre>

   <p>The second tool we need is the ability to turn a decimal number into an
integer number. Python has a built in function called <span>int()</span> which
outputs the largest integer (in absolute value) which is less (in absolute
value) than the given number.  So <span>int(7.5) = 7</span> and <span>int(-9.3)
= -9</span>. Another way to do this is to use the <span>math.floor()</span>
function which operates how you expect it to in math.
   </p>

<h3>trigProblem: number -&gt; string</h3>
   <p>Define a function called <span>trigProblem</span> which accepts as input
a number representing an angle, and produces as output a string of the form
"Solve the equation $\tan(2 \theta) = Q$ for $\theta$.", where Q is the tangent
of the input angle. This function should have two special behaviors:
<ol>
<li>If the input angle is not in the domain of tangent (specifically, within
0.001 of a value not in the domain of tangent), then the function should
instead return a problem of the form "Determine whether Q is in the domain of
the function $f(\theta) = \tan(2 \theta)$."
</li> 
<li>The value of Q should be expressed as a decimal with three digits of
precision.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>You can learn how to compute a tangent by looking up the name of the
function in the Python documentation for the <a
href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/math.html">math library</a></p>

<p>We also need to know how to put a number into a string in a pretty way. The
term for this in python is "string formatting," and a common way to do string
formatting is with the <span>%</span> operator. Here are some examples:</p>

<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; "I am %d years old!" % 26
'I am 26 years old!'
&gt;&gt;&gt; "This girl is %f meters tall" % (1/3)
'This girl is 0.333333 meters tall'
&gt;&gt;&gt; "This girl is %.3f meters tall" % (2/3)
'This girl is 0.667 meters tall'
</pre>

<p>Specifically, <span>%d</span> is used to convert integers to strings, and
<span>%f</span> is for decimals. To specify how much precision should come
after the decimal point use <span>%.nf</span> where <span>n</span> is your
desired precision.</p>

<h2> Submission </h2>
   <p>In order to submit, make sure your program is in a single file named
<span>lab1.py</span> and that your terminal is in the same directory as the
file (when you run the <span>ls</span> program you should see the file listed).
Then run the following terminal command:</p>

   <pre>
      $ submit lab1 lab1.py
   </pre>

   <p>Just to clarify, the <span>$</span> represents your terminal prompt, so
you shouldn't type that part (it's just there to say that this is a terminal
command). The name of the program is <span>submit</span>, the first argument is
the string <span>lab1</span>, which is the name of the lab, and the second
argument, <span>lab1.py</span>, is the location of the file you want to submit.
Note that it must be named lab1.py or my grading robot won't grade it.</p>
