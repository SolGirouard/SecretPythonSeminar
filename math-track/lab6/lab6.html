   <h1> Lab 6 </h1>
   <h2> Overview </h2> 

   <p>In this lab we will learn to work with iterators, generators, and exceptions.</p>

   <h2>Warm up</h2>
   <p>The functions implemented in this section should be submitted in a file
called <span>generators.py</span></p>

   <h3>catBetweenOdds: None -> iterable</h3>
   <p>Define a generator called <span>catBetweenOdds</span>, which accepts no
inputs, and produces a generator (using <span>yield</span>) which alternates
producing odd numbers in order and producing the string 'cat'. E.g. the
iterator starts:</p>

   <pre>1, 'cat', 3, 'cat', 5, 'cat', ...</pre> 

   <h3>subsequentPairs: iterable -> iterable</h3>
   <p>Define a generator called <span>subsequentPairs</span>, which accepts as
input an iterable, and generates (using <span>yield</span>) a sequence of
subsequent pairs of the elements of the input iterable. That is, given the
iterable starting with</p> 

   <pre>2,4,6,8,10,12,...</pre>

   <p><span>subsequentPairs</span> would produce an iterable starting as follows:</p>

   <pre>(2,4), (4,6), (4,6), (8,10), ...</pre>


   <h3>warnZeroDivision: function -> string</h3>
   <p>Define a function called <span>warnZeroDivision</span>, which accepts
as input a function <span>f</span> and produces as output a string. The
function <span>f</span> accepts no arguments as input and produces a string as
output. Your function <span>warnZeroDivision</span> should try to call
<span>f</span>. In the event that <span>f</span> raises a
<span>ZeroDivisionError</span>, your function should return the string
<span>"See me after class!"</span>, otherwise it should return the output of
<span>f</span></p>


   <h2>Look-and-say sequences</h2>
   <p>In a file called <span>lookandsay.py</span> define a class called
<span>LookAndSaySequence</span> representing a "look-and-say" sequence.</p>

   <p>Look-and-say sequences are defined by elaborating the following example, which is a look-and-say sequence starting at 1</p>

   <pre>1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, 312211, ...</pre>

   <p>Spoken out loud, this sequence is "one; one one; two one; one two, two
one; one one, one two, two one; ..." That is, the first number in the sequence
is one, and to get the second we look at the first, see a single one, say "one
one" out loud, and then use what we said to write down the next number in the
sequence, "11." To get the third entry, we look at the second entry (11), say,
"two one," and write down "21." For the fourth, we see one two followed by one
one, so "one two, one one" which gives "1211." Etc. </p>

   <h3>__init__: [float] -> Vector</h3> 

   <p>Your constructor for a <span>LookAndSaySequence</span> should accept as
input a single integer corresponding to the first integer of the sequence. This
number may be any positive integer. If it is not an integer at all, your
constructor should raise a <span>TypeError</span>, and if it is a negative
integer, your constructor should raise an <span>Exception</span> with the
message <span>"Starting value must be a positive integer"</span>.</p>

   
   <h3>__iter__, __next__</h3>
   
   <p>An instance of <span>LookAndSaySequence</span> should be an iterator. In
particular, it must implement the <span>__iter__</span> and
<span>__next__</span> methods.  The <span>__iter__</span> method should simply
<span>return self</span>, and the <span>__next__</span> method should allow one
to iterate through the LookAndSaySequence in order. That is, if I iterate over
a <span>LookAndSaySequence(1)</span> and print each entry, I should see the
following (infinite) output:</p>

   <pre>
      1
      11
      21
      1211
      111221
      ...
   </pre>

   <p>The only restriction is that the output of next() must be an int. You
have control over how else to implement your <span>LookAndSaySequence</span>
class. In particular, you may use any of python's built-in functions or
libraries to help you. Though you may find some of these functions useful, rest
assured that you have all the tools you need to solve this problem "from
scratch."</p>

   <h2>Fun Math Thing!</h2>

   <p>Look-and-say sequences seem very wild and unpredictable, don't they?
Obviously these sequences grow very quickly, but how quickly? If the
look-and-say sequence starts with 1, what can you reasonably conjecture about
how fast the number of digits of the terms of this sequence grows? That is, if
<span>a_i</span> is the number of digits in the <span>i</span>-th term, does
<span>a_i</span> grow like a polynomial? An exponential? Something else? Does
<span>a_{i+1} / a_i</span> converge? (You can conjecture an answer to this
question with the funtions you wrote in this lab)</p>

   <p>Does the answer to this question seem to depend on the start of the
sequence? Are there any trivial sequences you'd like to exclude from
consideration?</p>
