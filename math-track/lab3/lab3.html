   <h1> Lab 3 </h1>
   <h2> Overview </h2> 

   <p>In this lab we will practice using the design recipe to break a complicated program
into easier parts. We will only need to know two basic number theory definitions:</p>

   <ul> 
      <li>A <em>prime number</em> is a postive integer at least two which is divisible
         only by 1 and itself.</li> 
      <li>A <em>palindrome</em> is a positive integer whose digits
         are the same when read left-to-right as right-to-left.</li>
   </ul>
   
   <p>The goal of this lab is to produce a list of numbers which are both primes and
palindromes.  All of the work in this lab will be contained in a single file called
<span>lab3.py</span>.</p>

   <h2>Testing</h2>
   <p>As we saw before, I've provided a module called <a
href="unittest.py">unittest.py</a> which will allow you to write automated tests for your
program. Let's recall how to use it here.</p>

   <p>To download a copy of the file for your own use, simply run the terminal command:</p>

   <pre>
      $ wget http://math.uic.edu/~jkun2/SPS/unittest.py
   </pre>
   
   <p>This will download the file at the given location to the current directory.</p>

   <p>unittest.py includes a single function called "test" which accepts as input two
arguments (of any type). The first argument is the "expected" value of a function's
output, and the second argument is the "actual" value. The function raises an error if
the two arguments are not equal, and otherwise does nothing.</p>

   <p>To access the unittest module from within a python program, use import:</p>

   <pre>
      from unittest import test
   </pre>

   <p>For example, here is how one might test the square function</p>

   <pre>
      from unittest import test
   
      # square: number -> number
      # return the square of the input number.
      def square(x):
         return x * x

      test(4, square(2))
      test(1, square(-1))
      test(100, square(10))
   </pre>

   <p>As per the design recipe, the proper way to develop your code is to write tests
<em>first</em> so that you are complete sure about what the function is supposed to do,
and then fill in the body. This way, you can "test as you go," and ensure that the easier
tests pass before attempting to make the harder ones pass. If you make changes to
something later, all you need to do is run your program and make sure no tests fail, and
you can be reasonably confident your change did not break anything.</p>

   <h2>Implementation</h2>
   <p>There is only one required function for this lab, but the right way to go about
implementing it is to break the problem into simpler parts, and write functions to solve
the simpler parts. In the first two labs I did this for you, and now it's your
turn to do so. I strongly recommend using the design recipe on every function
you decide to create.</p>

   <h3>palindromePrimesBelow: int -> [int]</h3>
   <p>Define a function which accepts as input an integer and produces as output a list
of primes less than the input integer which are also palindromes. </p>


<h2> Submission </h2>
   <p>In order to submit, make sure your program is in a single file named
<span>lab3.py</span> and that your terminal is in the same directory as the
file (when you run the <span>ls</span> program you should see the file listed).
Then run the following terminal command:</p>

   <pre>
      $ submit lab3 lab3.py
   </pre>
