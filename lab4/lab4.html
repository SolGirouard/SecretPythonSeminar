   <h1> Lab 4 </h1>
   <h2> Overview </h2> 

   <p>In this lab we will learn to work with dictionaries, sets, and files, and
put them together to write functions that manipulate a gradebook according to a
fixed set of rules. To describe a dictionary type, I will use the notation
<span>{a:b}</span> where <span>a</span> and <span>b</span> refer to arbitrary
types. When I want to be generic and not commit to a choice of types, I will
use "key" for <span>a</span> and "value" for <span>b</span>.</p>

   <p>The notation I'll use for the type is a set containing values of a
certain type is <span>set(a)</span>.</p>

   <p>All of the work in this lab will be contained in a single file called
<span>lab4.py</span>.</p>

   <h2>Warm up</h2>
   <h3>subdict: {key: value}, string -> {key: value}</h3>
   <p>Define a function which accepts as input a dictionary and a string
<span>k</span>, and produces as output a new dictionary that contains all the
entries of the input dictionary whose keys contain <span>k</span> as a
substring.</p>

   <h3>dictSum: {key: value} -> float</h3>
   <p>Define a function which accepts as input a dictionary and values which
can be converted to floats using <span>float()</span>, and produces as output a
number which is the sum of all the values of the dictionary (interpreted as
floats).</p>



   <h2>Working with the gradebook</h2>
   <p>Before we can manipulate a gradebook, we have to decide how we're going
to represent the gradebook inside of python. There are many good choices, and
we will pick one of them arbitrarily so that we can practice using
dictionaries.</p>

   <p>From now on, a <span>gradebook</span> will refer to the type
<span>[{string: string}]</span>, that is, a list of <span>{string:
string}</span> dictionaries. Each dictionary in the list corresponds to a
student, and each entry in the dictionary corresponds to some information about
a student, such as an id number, an email, or a score on a particular
assignment. I will call <span>record</span> the type of an individual
entry.</p>

   <h3>loadGrades: string -> gradebook</h3>

   <p>Write a function that takes as input a string containing a filename,
reads in the data in that file, and produces as output a gradebook
corresponding to the contents of that file. The file will contain as its first
line a list of keys for each column, and each subsequent line corresponds to
the values for a particular student.</p>

   <p>An example file might contain the following:</p>

   <pre>
      id,email,hw1,exam1
      88,blah@blah.com,1,3
      12,foo@bar.baz,9,99
   </pre>

   <p>Before implementing this function, you should write down what the output
gradebook should look like (as a python type) and turn that into a test case.</p>
   <p>
      As a hint, you will want to use python's built-in <span>split</span> function for strings. Look up a tutorial online about how to use this function.
   </p>


   <h3>studentGrade: record -> string</h3>
   <p>Define a function which accepts as input a record and produces as output
a string representing an aggregate grade. Here are assumptions you get to make
and rules you must follow: </p>

   <ul>
      <li>Some key-value pairs in the input are irrelevant. The important ones
are those whose keys contain as a substring either the string "hw" or the
string "exam".</li>
      <li>The "hw" keys have values which are integers between 0 and 10
(inclusive), i.e. every homework assignment is worth 10 points.</li>
      <li>The "exam" keys are similar to the homework keys, except they are out
of 100 points.</li>
      <li>The function should output an aggregate grade in which "hw" entries
in total are worth 20% of the grade and "exam" entries in total are worth 80%
of the grade. The output should be expressed as a float between 0 and 1.</li>
      <li>To avoid strange floating point comparisons, the output should be
expressed as a string with 2 decimal digits of precision. I.e. use "%.2f" as
your format string.</li>
      <li>You may assume there is at least one entry in a record for 
"hw" and at least one entry for "exam".</li>
   </ul>


   <h3>allGrades: gradebook -> {string:string}</h3>
   <p>Define a function which accepts as input a gradebook and produces as output
a dictionary whose keys are student ids and whose values are grades (in
2-digit-precision string form). </p>


   <h3>atRisk: gradebook, float -> set(string)</h3>
   <p>Define a function which accepts as input a gradebook and a threshold (a
float between 0 and 1), and produces as output the set of student ids of those
students whose grades are each less than the given threshold.</p>

   <h3>processFailing: string, string -> None</h3>
   <p>Define a function which accepts as input two strings and behaves as
follows. The first string is a filename for a gradebook, which this function
loads into python. The second string is the filename for a new file which this
function should create, and when this function is finished the contents of this
new file should contain the emails and grades of each student whose grade is
less than 0.5 (after rounding), one per line, separated by a single space, with
the grade rounded as we've done previously.</p>

   <p>So, for example, if Jim Bob is has an aggregate grade of 0.4111111 and his
email is <span>jimbob@alabama.edu</span>, then the new file should contain a
line:</p>

   <pre>
      jimbob@alabama.edu 0.41
   </pre>

   <p>The file should be sorted by student id. This requires a new special
function that python has built in. If you are currently trying to loop over a
list, set, or dictionary, like:</p>

   <pre>
      for item in loopyThing:
         ...
   </pre>

   <p>And instead you want to iterate over <span>loopyThing</span> in sorted
order, you can do:</p>

   <pre>
      for item in sorted(loopyThing):
         ...
   </pre>

   <p>The <span>sorted</span> function knows how to sort anything that can be
iterated over that we have learned about. This is an example of duck-typing at
it's finest. If you actually want to produce a list that is the sorted order of
<span>loopyThing</span>, then you can do this with
<span>list(sorted(loopyThing))</span>.</p>


<h2> Submission </h2>
   <p>In order to submit, make sure your program is in a single file named
<span>lab4.py</span> and that your terminal is in the same directory as the
file (when you run the <span>ls</span> program you should see the file listed).
Then run the following terminal command:</p>

   <pre>
      $ submit lab4 lab4.py
   </pre>
