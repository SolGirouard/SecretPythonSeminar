   <h1> Lab 5 </h1>
   <h2> Overview </h2> 

   <p>In this lab we will learn to work with modules, objects, and learn to
read through the python documetation to get information about built-in python
functions.</p>

   <h2>Modules</h2>
   <p>The functions implemented in this section should be submitted in a file
called <span>modules.py</span></p>

   <h3>randomSplit: [a] -> set(a), set(a)</h3>
   <p>Define a function which accepts as input a list and produces as output
a tuple containing two sets. The first set is a random subset of half (rounded
down) of the entries of the input list, and the second set is the remaining
half. This function should not mutate the input list. This function should work
properly even when the input list is empty.</p>
   
   <p>To implement this function, use the <span>random</span> module which is
built in to python.</p>

   <h3>weekdayAsString: datetime -> string</h3>
   <p>Using the <span>datetime</span> module built into python, define a
function called <span>weekdayAsString</span> which accepts as input a datetime
object and produces as output the day of the week corresponding to that date.
That is, the output should be a string which is one of the following:
<span>["Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday",
"Saturday"]</span>.</p>


   <h3>subsetSum: [int], int -> boolean</h3>
   <p>Using the <span>itertools</span> module built into python, define a
function called <span>subsetSum</span> which accepts as input a list of ints
and a target int, and returns True if and only if there is a nonempty sub-list
of the input integers which sums to the target. For example
<span>subsetSum([1,1,3,5,7], 2)</span> is True. Note: do not test this on large
input lists, because if P is different from NP then your program will
definitely be slow.</p>


   <h2>Dog</h2>

   <p>Write a class called <span>Dog</span> representing a dog with the
following methods.</p>

   <h3>__init__: float, datetime -> Dog</h3>
   <p>The constructor for a Dog should accept as input a float representing the
Dog's weight and a datetime representing the Dog's birthday. A successfuly
created Dog has an attribute called <span>weight</span> containing the Dog's
current weight. You also need to keep track of the birthday as an attribute,
but I don't require you to give it a specific name.</p>

   <h3>speak: Dog -> string</h3>
   <p>Define a method on Dogs called <span>speak</span> which accepts no inputs
(except the context object) and returns as output the string
<span>"Woof!"</span>.</p>

   <h3>age: Dog, datetime -> int</h3>
   <p>Define a method on Dogs called <span>age</span> which accepts as input a
datetime (representing the current date and time, although it can be any
datetime object), and produces as output an int representing the Dog's age (in
human years).</p>

   <h3>eat: Dog, float -> None</h3>
   <p>Define a method on Dogs called <span>eat</span>, which accepts as input a
floating point number representing the weight of food being fed to the Dog. The
method produces no output, but instead changes the value of the Dog's weight
attribute by adding the input weight to the total weight.</p>


   <h2>Vector</h2>
   <p>Write a class called <span>Vector</span> representing a vector with the
following methods.</p>

   <h3>__init__: [float] -> Vector</h3>
   <p>The constructor for a Vector should accept as input a list of floats representing the
coordinates of the vector. Vectors have an attribute called <span>coords</span>
containing a list of the Vector's coordinates.</p>

   <h3>__len__: Vector -> int</h3>
   <p>Override the <span>__len__</span> method on Vectors, which allows the
user of the Vector class to call <span>len(v)</span> on a Vector
<span>v</span>. This method should return the dimension of the Vector.</p>

   <h3>__eq__: Vector, Vector -> boolean</h3>
   <p>Override the <span>__eq__</span> method on Vectors, which allows the
user of the Vector class to call <span>v == w</span> on two Vectors
<span>v,w</span>. This method should return True if and only if all the entries
of the two Vectors are the same. This method should not assume the two Vectors
have the same dimension. Ignore issues of floating point precision.</p>

   <h3>__add__: Vector, Vector -> Vector</h3>
   <p>Override the <span>__add__</span> method on Vectors, which allows the
user of the Vector class to call <span>v + w</span> on two Vectors
<span>v, w</span>. This method should return the Vector represeting the
coordinate-wise sum of each input vector.</p>
   
   <h3>scale: Vector, float -> Vector</h3>
   <p>Define a method <span>scale</span> on Vectors, which accepts as input a
float (and the context object) and produces as output a new Vector whose
coordinates are the coordinates of the context vector scaled by the given
float. E.g. <span>Vector([1,2,3]).scale(7) == Vector(7,14,21)</span></p>

   <h3>projectivelyEquivalent: Vector, Vector -> boolean</h3>
   <p>Define a method <span>projectivelyEquivalent</span> on Vectors, which
accepts as input the context Vector and a second vector, and outputs True if
and only if the two vectors are projectively equivalent. Two nonzero
Vectors <span>v,w</span> are called "projectively equivalent" if there is a
nonzero real number <span>c</span> such that <span>v.scale(c) == w</span>. If
either of the two Vectors is the zero Vector, return False. Ignore issues that
would arise from floating point numbers being inexact.</p>
   
   <h2>Extra credit</h2>
   <p>Look up on the internet how to use python's <span>smtplib</span> library
to send me an email via Gmail. Test the program by sending yourself email
first :)</p>
